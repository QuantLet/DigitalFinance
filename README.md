The Action will investigate AI and Fintech from three different angles: Transparency in FinTech, Transparent versus Black Box Decision-Support Models in the Financial Industry, and Transparency into Investment Product Performance for Clients. The Action will bridge the gap between academia, industry, the public, and governmental organizations by working in an interdisciplinary way across Europe and focusing on innovation.
